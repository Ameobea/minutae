## JS Helpers

This library contains helper functions and utilities designed to be implemented in JavaScript for use in minutiae simulations.  The idea is that they will be exposed to minutiae as remote functions through the `Module` interface, giving access to helpful JS-only libraries and feature that are more easily implemented in JavaScript.
