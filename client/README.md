# Minutae Remote Client Implementation

The goal of this module is to implement a remote client that receives data from a server and displays it in a web browser.  This allows for the computationally heavy work of processing entities and performing the simulation itself to be offloaded to a central location while light clients simply submit actions and receive updates.
